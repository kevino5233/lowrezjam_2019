This game uses the following libraries:
[nanort](https://github.com/lighttransport/nanort)

NOTES
measure performance rate w/ one bunny + variable number of bunnies
    pretty good! keep an eye on this. looks like max tree depth is the most important factor here

TODO
bunnys don't render right. figure out why. Test with cubes?
    it was with the bunny
mouse controls
add lighting
mac build
